# Longer Weather

This software downloads short GIFs at predefined intervals, extracts the frames, and combines them into a longer GIF. It is useful for automatically generating longer GIFs from short GIFs that are updated, such as weather radar animations. Two weather radar GIFs from intellicast.net are used by default, but it should work with any GIF.
